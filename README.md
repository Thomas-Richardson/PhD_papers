Analysis scripts for work I did during my PhD in Evolution Biology and Psychology. You can find the papers on my scholar profile: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Z2_jROYAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=sra

I'm storing it here to ensure my work remain reproducible, not because I expect anyone to get value from the code. I wasn't great at R back then!
