The data and code to reproduce all analyses and graphs from the published paper of the same name, open access found here: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513820301379

Includes a data cleaning script to show how I cleaned the original European Social Survey data for use. Showcases my skills in mixed effects models, graphs in GGplot, producing tables of summary statistics as well as regression results tables that can both be inserted into reports with minimal formatting. 

It also features extensive robustness checks of the main results of the paper to see if they hold when several assumptions are relaxed. While this level of rigour is common in disciplines such as economics, in my disicpline of psychology it is rare.
