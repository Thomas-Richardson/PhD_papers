# Do MMA fighters with longer arms win more fights? 
Data and code my published paper of the same name. The paper is available open access here: https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2020-39190-001.html

This paper is relatively simple from an analytics point of view, mainly including multiple regressions and graphs. It also features some cool code to assign a sex to each fighter based on census data. 

You can play around with the data and run the analysis yourself using Binder here: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Thomas-Richardson/Is-Arm-Length-a-Sexually-Selected-Trait-in-Humans-Evidence-From-Mixed-Martial-Arts/master?urlpath=rstudio)
